            <b><em> WHEN YOU ARE ANGRY is a vizualized podcast </em></b> that focuses on the female experience, and how it can be angering growing up with societal expectations that are put on you just because you are a woman. Currently, WHEN YOU ARE ANGRY emphasises subtle and mundane topics that are often overlooked as repressive to women.
        </p>

        <p>WHEN YOU ARE ANGRY hopes to create a community of women, and a safe and open space where everyone feels comfortable talking about stories and moments surrounding womanhood.
