      <h2>Project 1: Interactive Audio & Visual with p5.js</h2>
      <a href="https://editor.p5js.org/eilythia.penati/sketches/ZqtWEid1s">WHEN YOU ARE ANGRY</a>
        <p> This project is based on a podcast I did last year about beauty standards. I wanted to create a space where I could talk with some people about their experience with beauty standards and body image throughout their life. The words in the background is one of my favorite quotes from the podcast that I felt represents what we were talking about. I also wanted to utilize the sound input through screaming because the podcast is called when you are angry.</p>
      
      <h2>Project 2: HyperNarrative</h2>
      <a href="https://eilythia-ghost.glitch.me/">ghost</a>
        <p> My project is called “ghost”. I wanted to capture the feeling of starting to trust someone new in a relationship or friendship. I thought this would be interesting to capture through a dream/nightmare-like project because I feel like often when this happens I can get in my own head about how relationships are going, it can almost feel like I am talking to two versions of myself.  I did a photo/video shoot with my friends Ginger and Emiko and then turned the photos into a gif. I tried to use motion blur to show that it was in a dream and I tried to utilize aspects that could appear and disappear to show to symbolize a ghost-like image. I really enjoy websites and projects that have hidden aspects where if an audience member really enjoyed it they will continue to look at it and find new things each time. I tried to do that with this project with some more “hidden” pages and words. I hope you enjoy it! </p>

          <h2>WEEK 1</h2>
<p>Cataloguing Change: Women, Art and Technology showed the true start of computer art, which was mainly pioneered by women, even though this was not reflected to the public. This reading was very informative to me, as I did not know much about the history of computer art, especially the contributions women had to it. One interesting point was that women were often teaching and curating digital art, which led the concept of digital art to expand, however programming opportunities continued to be marketed towards men and masculinised. To me, this can connect to Leslie Mezei’s writing in the Ataria Archives because her concerns about computer art/programming not having the same amount of “critical judgment” as other mediums of art do.
How do you think the rise of masculinised programming affected the trends and styles of computer art at the time? In what ways specifically can computer scientists also be considered artists (as Leslie Mezei’s writing says)? When do you think there became more of a divide between programming computers and creating computer art?

<p>Odell’s text “How to Internet” made me very emotional for reasons I do not understand. The beginning of the text interested me by showing how the progression of internet users have drifted from business usage, personal and realistic usage, to heavily produced usage.This makes me think about last week's reading with Lialina’s writing where they say technology is almost supposed to seem “invisible”. However, Odell’s writing makes it seem as though content is going towards unlife-like (not a real word) is made by conforming to an algorithm from a company that is sponsoring something. I think it makes me sad because Odell writes so passionately about “the old internet” and how it is basically gone forever. It was very sad and makes me lose hope for the future of the internet/tech/human connection.

Why is content becoming so unrealistic and not based on true connectivity, when people strive for real connection? How do you think that connection today through the internet should be changed to create more realistic human connection? Is the mystery and curiosity about the internet one of the reasons it felt so special when connecting with new people? Will we ever get that back? </p>
                      <h2>WEEK 4</h2>
<p>In Defense of the Poor Image reminded me of a question that I had been thinking about a lot this week. "Does looking at art that the audience finds "beautiful" make the experience and message more impactful (if the message is not commenting on beauty already)? I thought that Hito Steryl's writing was an interesting take on this question because she was saying that resolution has been the determinor of "rich" or "poor" images. I agree with this thinking that the need for a high quality image has become much too extreme and unnecessary. Especially when making films on a budget. Quality can become very competitive, even in a classroom setting. I think that lower quality images also show that there is some sort of story behind the image, especially low quality images online. Where is this image really coming from, has the person who uploaded this resizes, cropped, changed it? Why? 

Are lower quality images visually less beautiful to look at? Do you think the poor image becomes more interesting thinking about it having a story coming from the original creation? What makes poor images more laughable?

 <h2>WEEK 5</h2>
<p>I thought that Joy Boulamwini’s Ted Talk was very informative about what we can do in regards to helping change discriminatory code. I feel like I have heard these statements about how code is discriminatory towards darker skin tones a lot throughout the past couple of years with new tech like Tesla and facial recognition. It reminds me of when film photography was a new product and only white skin tones developed properly, then when they created new technology to have other skin tones develop, they advertised it in a very discriminatory way. I appreciated Boulamwini’s talk because they informed the audience about the issue, but then told what I can do to help and took action with the Algorithmic Justice League. This gave me more information to learn how to help stop discriminatory code, which is something that I have never been show by others who talk about discriminatory code. Questions: How long do you think it will take for old discriminatory code to be phased out with new code that is more accurate with facial recognition for all skin types? What is something that people who use code, but do not code themselves, can do to to help highlight inclusive code? How do we prevent future technology from being discriminatory? </p>
           <h2>WEEK 6</h2>

I thought Ari Melanciano's talk was very interesting and somewhat overwhelming, but in a calming way. The talk covered so many aspects of how we live life and it made me think about how I can become more purposeful with my decisions day to day. One part that really stuck out to me was when Ari was talking about consumerism and how we do not have to buy as many things as we do. I am someone that always loves to buy things and feel like I am getting something fun, but I also think that this habit can be wasteful and it was a good reminder to listen to that in the talk. I also thought an interesting point was when Ari talked about how if marginalized people can see a healthy and fruitful future, that means that we will all see a healthy and fruitful future. I think often there is this idea that if we give resources to marginalized groups it will take away from un-marginalized groups. However, this does not really make any sense because once people with least accessibility to resources get this accessibility, then everyone will end up having all the resources! I thought this was a very good way to phrase this.
 
How do we create designs with more intention that can be more resourceful?
Why do we feel that giving more resources to one group means taking away from another? Can it not be both
How do we continue to ensure that we are creating things that will help move towards our "end goal" as a society instead of falling into instant gratification?

WEEK 7
I really enjoyed this weeks reading. I thought it was very informational and also inspiring. Ive always wanted to learn ASL and I have learned little bit, but I always it difficult to practice because not many people know ASL. I loved Kim’s overall theme of taking something that she did not have a lot of access to, like sound, and allow herself to gain access to it, also letting her enter this new world ( of sound). It was very inspiring to se someone take something and make it their own. I also thought it was a new way to look at sound, visually through lines and hand motions. It makes me reimagine other senses we have that are usually taken for granted. I think that makes more sense to me why Kim was discussing sound like it was currency because I think that people react to their senses much more than they realize, so to be someone that doesn’t have one of the senses must be confusing and you would probably interpret reactions differently. How can we incorporate this TedTalk into our class/code? How can we think about our senses or things that we do everyday as humans differently? How can we include that into our art? What does your identity mean? What does it mean if other people are speaking/doing things for you on your behalf?
